Overview
============
DDColorPicker is a pod allowing colors to be picked from a color palette.
It allows for transparency and lightness to be altered with sliders.

It uses the delegate pattern to inform the calling class of the color selected.


Authors
============
The primary author of this library is Vasco d'Orey, but it is also maintained by other developers within Tasboa.

This project is part of a larger Tasboa project and it was built because we felt that there was a need for a beautiful color picker that was easier to use.
